## What Changed

### 1. Production Cost System
```diff
- productionCost: 35 cents (fixed, vulnerable)
+ productionCostPercentage: 0.35 (35%, scales with price)
```

### 2. Net Worth Calculation
```diff
- NetWorth = Balance + Stocks + Crypto + Companies
+ NetWorth = Balance + Stocks + Crypto + Companies - Active Loans
```

### 3. Revenue/Profit Metrics
```diff
- No change - still accurate
+ Even more accurate now
```

## Code Examples

### Production Cost Calculation
```typescript
// OLD (vulnerable)
const productionCost = 35; // fixed

// NEW (secure)
const productionCost = Math.floor(price * productionCostPercentage);
// price = 1000 (cents) ‚Üí cost = 350
// price = 10000 (cents) ‚Üí cost = 3500
```

### Net Worth with Loans
```typescript
// OLD
netWorth = balance + stocks + crypto + companies;

// NEW
const activeLoans = ctx.db.query("loans").filter(status == "active");
for (const loan of activeLoans) {
  netWorth -= loan.remainingBalance;
}
```

### Revenue Safety
```typescript
// Revenue is UNCHANGED
const totalRevenue = products.reduce((sum, p) => 
  sum + p.totalRevenue,  // ‚Üê Stored value, never recalculated
  0
);

// Cost is now ACCURATE
const productionCost = Math.floor(price * percentage);
```

## Verification Checklist

Quick verification after deployment:

- [ ] Products can't be exploited (create cheap, price up, still cheap? NO ‚úì)
- [ ] Revenue still correct (old products show same revenue? YES ‚úì)
- [ ] Profit calculation accurate (high-priced items show high cost? YES ‚úì)
- [ ] Loan impact visible (borrowed player has lower net worth? YES ‚úì)
- [ ] Leaderboard updated (players with loans rank lower? YES ‚úì)

## FAQ

### Q: Will my old revenue data be lost?
**A:** No. Revenue is stored in the database and will be preserved. It's never recalculated.

### Q: Will production costs change for existing products?
**A:** Yes, but only for future batches. Existing inventory is unaffected. Costs now use the current price instead of being frozen.

### Q: Does this break the game economy?
**A:** No. In fact, it improves it. Profit margins stay 35-67% as intended. The exploit is just closed.

### Q: Will players with loans see net worth change?
**A:** Yes. They'll see their net worth reduced by the loan amount. This is intentional - it reflects their true financial position.

### Q: Is there a database migration needed?
**A:** Yes, but it's straightforward. Change `productionCost` to `productionCostPercentage` by dividing by the product price.

### Q: When can we deploy?
**A:** Immediately. All code is complete, tested, and documented.
