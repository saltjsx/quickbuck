## Security Assessment

### Exploit Prevention
✅ Production cost exploit closed  
✅ No way to lock in cheap costs  
✅ Price changes affect future batches  
✅ Cannot manipulate cost calculations  

### Financial Safety
✅ Revenue cannot be inflated  
✅ Profit calculations accurate  
✅ Loan amounts tracked correctly  
✅ Net worth reflects true position  

### Data Integrity
✅ No historical data loss  
✅ All fields properly validated  
✅ Type safety maintained  
✅ No integer overflows  

---

## Performance Considerations

### Frontend Changes
✅ Calculations performed client-side  
✅ No additional database queries  
✅ No performance degradation  
✅ Calculations efficient  

### Backend Changes
✅ One additional query (get active loans)  
✅ Query uses index (`by_playerId`)  
✅ Filter uses indexed field (`status`)  
✅ Minimal performance impact  

### Scalability
✅ Loan query scales with loan count (typically small)  
✅ Production cost calculation O(1)  
✅ Dashboard stats calculation efficient  

---

## Backward Compatibility

### Database
✅ Schema change requires migration  
✅ Migration path documented  
✅ No data corruption risk  
✅ Can be rolled back if needed  

### API
✅ Existing queries still work  
✅ New field name documented  
✅ Old field can be deprecated  

### Client
✅ Frontend calculations updated  
✅ Dashboard displays correct values  
✅ No user-facing breaking changes  

---

## User Impact Assessment

### Positive Changes
✅ Fairer product pricing system  
✅ No exploitable loopholes  
✅ More accurate profit calculations  
✅ Net worth reflects true debt  
✅ Leaderboards more competitive  

### Neutral Changes
✅ Production cost always 35-67% of price  
✅ Revenue calculations unchanged  
✅ Company finances unchanged  
✅ Game mechanics largely unchanged  

### No Negative Changes
✅ No feature removal  
✅ No balance issues  
✅ No gameplay disruption  

---

## Known Limitations

### Migration Required
- ⚠️ Existing products need to have `productionCostPercentage` calculated from `productionCost`
- Solution: One-time migration script

### Loan Query Performance
- ℹ️ Net worth calculation performs one additional query to fetch loans
- Mitigation: Query uses indexes and filters on small dataset
- Impact: Negligible for most deployments

---
