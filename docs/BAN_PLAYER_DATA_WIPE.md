# Ban Player Feature - Complete Data Wipe ✅

## Change Summary

Updated the `banPlayer` mutation in `convex/moderation.ts` to completely wipe ALL player data when they are banned.

## What's Deleted

When a player is banned, the following is completely removed:

### Assets & Ownership
- ✅ All companies owned
- ✅ All products in those companies
- ✅ All stocks
- ✅ All cryptocurrencies created
- ✅ All stocks/cryptos held
- ✅ All company shares

### Activity & Transactions
- ✅ All carts and cart items

- ✅ All loans
- ✅ All inventory items
- ✅ All upgrades purchased
- ✅ All gambling history

### Account State
- ✅ Balance set to 0
- ✅ Role set to "banned"
- ✅ Ban reason recorded

## What's Preserved

### Admin Records (Intentional)
- 📝 Ban record with reason
- 📝 Moderation history
- 📝 Stock/crypto price history (for market analysis)
- 📝 Global alerts (to preserve moderation messages)

## Implementation

**File:** `convex/moderation.ts`

**Method:** Comprehensive data deletion with proper dependency ordering
- Deletes items before containers
- Deletes holdings before owners
- Finally marks player as banned

## Safety Features

✅ Only mods/admins can execute
✅ Cannot ban self
✅ Cannot ban other admins
✅ Audit trail preserved
✅ Clean state after ban

## Example

```
Player alice is banned for "Violating ToS"
├─ Companies deleted (and their products, stocks)
├─ Cryptos deleted
├─ Holdings cleared
├─ Transactions deleted
├─ Loans cleared
├─ Inventory cleared
├─ Balance → 0
└─ Status → banned
```

## No Breaking Changes

✅ Existing code works as-is
✅ Only affects ban operation
✅ No API changes
✅ Backward compatible

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE AND READY**

Banning a player now provides total data cleanup while maintaining audit trails.
