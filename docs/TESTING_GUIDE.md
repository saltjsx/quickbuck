## What Was Done

### Problem Identified

✅ Created admin page for stock initialization
✅ All code verified - 0 errors, type-safe

### Result

✅ Updates every 5 minutes automatically
✅ Real-time via Convex reactivity
✅ Graceful fallback while loading
✅ Production ready for deployment

## How to Test

### Test 1: Initialize (5 min)
```
→ Go to /admin/stocks
→ Click "Initialize Stock Market"
→ Verify 5 stocks appear
✅ Success: TCH, ENRG, GFC, MHS, CGC
```

### Test 2: View Charts (2 min)
```
→ Go to /stocks
→ Check mini charts show REAL data
→ Not generic seeded patterns
✅ Success: Real line movements
```

### Test 3: Detail Page (2 min)
```
→ Click any stock (e.g., /stocks/TCH)
→ View full price history chart
✅ Success: Multiple data points
```

### Test 4: Trigger Update (3 min)
```
→ Go to /admin/tick
→ Click "Execute Tick"
→ Go back to stock page
→ Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
✅ Success: New data point appears
```

### Test 5: Wait for Auto-Update (5 min)
```
→ Keep page open for 5+ minutes
→ Cron job runs automatically
→ Chart updates in real-time
✅ Success: New data appears without refresh
```

**Total Test Time:** ~20 minutes

## What You'll See

### Before This Fix ❌
```
Stock page loads
→ Charts show generic up/down patterns
→ All stocks look similar
→ Chart never updates
→ Price static until page refresh
→ Database updates invisible
```

### After This Fix ✅
```
Stock page loads
→ Charts show REAL price history
→ Each stock has unique pattern
→ Chart updates every 5 minutes
→ Real-time updates via Convex
→ Database changes visible immediately
```
