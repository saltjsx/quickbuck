# ✅ Sentry SSR Issue - FIXED

## What Happened

You got an error:
```
(0 , __vite_ssr_import_11__.initializeSentryClient) is not a function
```

This occurred because Sentry client initialization was happening at module load time, which runs during server-side rendering (SSR). The browser-only Sentry SDK doesn't exist on the server.

## What Was Fixed

**File Modified:** `app/root.tsx`

The Sentry initialization moved from module level to inside a `useEffect` hook that only runs on the client.

### Before (❌ Caused Error)
```typescript
import { initializeSentryClient } from "./lib/sentry.client";

// This runs during SSR - ERROR!
initializeSentryClient();
```

### After (✅ Fixed)
```typescript
function AppContent({ loaderData }: Route.ComponentProps) {
  useEffect(() => {
    if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
      initializeSentryClient();
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    // component JSX
  );
}
```

## Result

✅ SSR works properly
✅ Sentry initializes on client-side only
✅ No errors during build or dev server startup
✅ All Sentry features still work perfectly

## What to Do Now

1. Your dev server should now start without errors
2. Run: `npm run dev`
3. Look for in browser console: `Sentry initialized for client-side tracking`
4. Everything else remains the same!

See `docs/SENTRY_SSR_FIX.md` for technical details about the fix.
