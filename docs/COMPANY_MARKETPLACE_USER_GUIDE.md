## Troubleshooting

**"Insufficient balance"**
- You don't have enough money to make this offer
- Check your balance in the top-right of the marketplace

**"Cannot buy your own company"**
- You're trying to buy a company you own
- This is not allowed to prevent self-dealing

**"Company is already listed"**
- This company is already on the marketplace
- Cancel the existing listing first

**"Cannot cancel listing with pending offers"**
- Reject or accept all offers first
- Then you can cancel the listing

**Notification won't disappear**
- This is intentional - you must take action
- Accept, reject, or counter the offer
