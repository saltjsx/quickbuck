## What to Look For

âœ… **Successful Initialization**
- Admin page shows "Initialized" status
- 5 stocks listed: TCH, ENRG, GFC, MHS, CGC
- Each stock has a current price

âœ… **Real Charts**
- Stock cards show line charts (not flat lines)
- Chart lines show up/down movements
- Multiple data points visible
- Prices match the displayed current price

âœ… **Real-Time Updates**
- After clicking tick, new data appears
- Charts add new point each tick
- Stock prices change slightly up/down
- Charts don't show identical patterns across stocks

---

## Files Changed

**New Files:**
- `app/hooks/use-stock-price-history.ts` - Fetches real price history
- `app/routes/admin/stocks.tsx` - Stock initialization admin page

**Modified Files:**
- `app/components/price-chart.tsx` - Uses real data instead of generated
- `app/routes/stocks.tsx` - Pass stockId to enable real data
- `app/routes/stocks.$symbol.tsx` - Pass stockId to enable real data

---

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Charts still show generated patterns**
A: 
1. Check if stocks are initialized: `/admin/stocks`
2. Hard refresh page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Wait for first tick to run (up to 5 min)

**Q: Admin page shows error**
A:
1. Ensure dev server running: `npm run dev`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify you have admin role

**Q: Prices not updating after tick**
A:
1. Check `/admin/tick` for recent ticks
2. Verify tick completed successfully
3. Hard refresh page
4. Check browser network tab for API calls

**Q: Charts look weird or show NaN**
A:
1. Stocks may not be initialized
2. Go to `/admin/stocks` and initialize
3. Hard refresh and try again
