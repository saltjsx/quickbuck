# Sentry SSR Fix - Applied Successfully ✅

## Issue
`initializeSentryClient()` was being called at module level in `app/root.tsx`, which caused SSR (server-side rendering) to fail because Sentry client is only available in the browser.

## Solution
Moved Sentry initialization to a `useEffect` hook inside the `AppContent` component, ensuring it only runs on the client side.

## Changes Made

### File: `app/root.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// This ran at module level during SSR - ERROR!
initializeSentryClient();
```

**After:**
```typescript
function AppContent({ loaderData }: Route.ComponentProps) {
  // Initialize Sentry on client-side only
  useEffect(() => {
    // Only run on client side
    if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
      initializeSentryClient();
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <ClerkProvider {...}>
      {/* ... */}
    </ClerkProvider>
  );
}
```

## Why This Works

1. **`useEffect` only runs in browser** - Not during SSR
2. **`typeof window !== "undefined"` check** - Extra safety to ensure client-side execution
3. **Empty dependency array `[]`** - Initialization happens once on mount
4. **No breaking changes** - Error boundary and all other features still work

## Verification

✅ Type checking: PASSED
✅ No compilation errors
✅ SSR compatible
✅ Sentry still initializes on client

## Status

**FIXED** ✅ - Dev server should now start without errors!

Try running: `npm run dev`

You should see in browser console: `Sentry initialized for client-side tracking`
