# ✅ MAINTENANCE MODE - COMPLETE IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

## What You Asked For

> "Add a maintenance mode screen, that only admins can enable. The maintenance mode is a separate page, and when a player tries accessing any other page, it takes them to maintenance mode, but keep the panel accessible to admins, so they can disable it. Mods should not be able to access the panel."

## What You Got

A fully-implemented, production-ready maintenance mode system that:

✅ Only admins can enable/disable  
✅ Non-admins are automatically redirected to maintenance page  
✅ Admins can access the admin panel during maintenance  
✅ Mods are explicitly excluded from the admin panel  
✅ Maintenance page is separate from admin controls  
✅ Custom messages support  
✅ Timestamp tracking  
✅ Internal reason logging  

## Implementation Details

### Backend (Convex)
- **File**: `convex/maintenance.ts` - Ready to use
- **Queries**: `getMaintenanceStatus()` - Fetches current state
- **Mutations**: 
  - `enableMaintenanceMode(message, reason)` - Admin only
  - `disableMaintenanceMode()` - Admin only

### Frontend (React)
- **Admin Panel**: `/admin/maintenance` - Control panel for admins
- **Public Page**: `/maintenance` - Shown to non-admins
- **Auto-redirect**: `MaintenanceCheck` component in dashboard
- **Routes**: Both configured in `app/routes.ts`
