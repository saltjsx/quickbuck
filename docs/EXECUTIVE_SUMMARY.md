# Executive Summary 🎯

## What Was Done

Three major improvements to the Quickbuck economy:

### 1. ✅ Production Cost Exploit Patched
**Problem:** Players could create cheap products, increase the price, and still produce at the old low cost.

**Solution:** Changed from storing absolute `productionCost` to storing `productionCostPercentage`. Cost is now calculated dynamically:
```
Cost = Price × Production Cost Percentage
```

**Result:** Production cost always scales with price. Exploit impossible.

**Files Changed:** 6 (schema, products, dashboard, 2 test files)  
**Impact:** Security + Fairness  

---

### 2. ✅ Revenue/Profit Metrics Protected
**Verification:** Confirmed all revenue and profit metrics are unaffected and remain accurate.

**Key Points:**
- Revenue is stored at time of sale (immutable)
- Production costs now calculated dynamically (more accurate)
- Profit = Revenue - Costs (always correct)
- Historical data preserved

**Result:** Game economy metrics are reliable and trustworthy.

**Files Changed:** 1 (dashboard)  
**Impact:** Data Integrity + Reliability  

---

### 3. ✅ Loan Impact on Net Worth
**Feature:** Unpaid loans now reduce player net worth based on remaining balance.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
NetWorth = Balance + Stocks + Crypto + Companies - Active Loans
```

**Example:**
- Player balance: $10,000
- Assets: $10,000
- Active loans: $5,000 (unpaid)
- **Net Worth: $15,000** (not $20,000)

**Result:** Net worth accurately reflects financial position including debt.

**Files Changed:** 1 (players.ts)  
**Impact:** Financial Accuracy + Accountability
