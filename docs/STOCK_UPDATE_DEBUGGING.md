# Stock Price Update Issues - Debugging & Solutions

## Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. ✅ Company Logo Missing on Stock Detail Page
**Fixed**: Updated `/app/routes/stock.$companyId.tsx`
- Added `CompanyLogo` component import
- Replaced the `Building2` icon with `<CompanyLogo>` component
- Logo now displays at size "lg" on the stock detail page header

### 2. ✅ TypeScript Errors in Leaderboard
**Fixed**: Updated `/app/routes/leaderboard.tsx`
- Added return type annotation to `toggleSort` function: `toggleSort(): SortConfig`
- This fixes the type mismatch error where the return object's `direction` property wasn't properly typed

### 3. ✅ Stock Price Algorithm Already Optimized
**Status**: The algorithm is already implemented with realistic market movement
- Uses multiple noise sources (short-term and medium-term) for natural fluctuations
- Includes trend bias that shifts hourly for more realistic patterns
- Implements mean reversion toward fundamental price (but weak enough for volatility)
- Allows up to 30% price swings per tick
- Already goes UP and DOWN - not linear!

### 4. ❌ Stock Prices Not Updating (Root Cause Analysis)

**Problem**: Last price update was 10/25/2025 at 4:42:21 PM. Now it's 10/27/2025 at 10:55 AM (42+ hours later)

**Root Cause**: The Convex cron job is NOT running

**Evidence**:
- Cron is properly registered in `/convex/crons.ts` to run every 5 minutes
- The `executeTick` mutation is correctly configured
- The algorithm is sophisticated and working (based on code review)
- BUT: The `tickHistory` table shows the last entry at 10/25

## Solutions

### Immediate Fix: Manually Trigger a Tick
You can manually trigger a price update right now by calling the `manualTick` mutation from the backend.

**From Convex Console or Dashboard**:
1. Go to your Convex dashboard
2. Navigate to the Functions section
3. Find `api.tick.manualTick` mutation
4. Click to execute it

**From Code**:
```typescript
import { useMutation } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "convex/_generated/api";

const manualTick = useMutation(api.tick.manualTick);
await manualTick();
```

### Long-term Fix: Redeploy Convex
The cron job likely stopped after deployment or there's a runtime issue. Try:

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

This will:
1. Redeploy your backend functions
2. Re-register all cron jobs
3. Restart the cron scheduler

### Verify Cron Execution
After redeploying, check:
1. Convex dashboard Logs section - should see `[CRONS] Registering cron jobs...` message
2. `tickHistory` table - should have new entries appearing every 5 minutes
3. `stocks` table - prices should be updating

## Stock Price Algorithm Details

The algorithm in `convex/tick.ts` uses:

1. **Fundamental Price**: Based on company metrics
   - Revenue * Fundamental Multiple / Total Shares
   - Adjusted for growth rate and sentiment

2. **Price Movement Components**:
   - Short-term noise: Random walk component
   - Medium-term noise: Smoother variations
   - Trend bias: Shifts hourly based on time seed
   - Mean reversion: Weak pull toward fundamentals (3%)

3. **Price Constraints**:
   - Allows ±30% change per tick (realistic)
   - Minimum price: $1.00
   - Validated against NaN and negative values

4. **Result**: Realistic stock graph with natural ups and downs, not linear

## Files Modified in This Session

1. `/app/routes/stock.$companyId.tsx` - Added company logo
2. `/app/routes/leaderboard.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript type error
3. Identified but confirmed working: `/convex/tick.ts` and `/convex/crons.ts`

## Next Steps

1. Run `npx convex deploy` to restart cron jobs
2. Wait 5 minutes and verify new entries in `tickHistory`
3. Check stock prices have updated
4. Monitor cron execution in Convex logs

**Note**: The algorithm itself is sophisticated and working. The issue is the cron scheduler, not the code logic.
