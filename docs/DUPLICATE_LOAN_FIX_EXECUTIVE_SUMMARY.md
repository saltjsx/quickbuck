# üéØ COMPREHENSIVE DUPLICATE LOAN FIX - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## The Problem

Player `nh7bpj2xf1b9qw7x3gx803gr7h7tfqk7` received duplicate loan credits due to a race condition in concurrent loan requests, resulting in:
- **Balance:** -$347.68 (NEGATIVE)
- **Debt:** $100,347.68 (including interest)
- **Assets:** $233,181.10 (company value)
- **Net Worth:** $132,485.74 (POSITIVE - assets cover debt)

### Root Cause
Two simultaneous loan requests created **2 duplicate transactions at the exact same millisecond**, but only **1 loan record** was tracked. This created an untracked credit that wasn't reflected in the loan balance.

---

## The Solution: Multi-Layered Fix

### üõ°Ô∏è 8 Protection Layers

| Layer | How It Works |
|-------|------------|
| **Deduplication** | Idempotency keys prevent duplicate client requests |
| **Duplicate Detection** | 2-second window catches concurrent identical requests |
| **Atomic Operations** | Loan created BEFORE balance credited |
| **Validation** | Balance calculations checked for overflow |
| **Audit Trail** | All transactions linked to loans for investigation |
| **Schema Integrity** | New fields and indices enforce data structure |
| **Hourly Monitoring** | Automated check detects any new issues |
| **Repair Tools** | Admin functions to fix detected problems |

## Key Features

### ‚ú® New Admin Functions

```bash
# Detect duplicate issues
npx convex run moderation:detectDuplicateLoanCredits \
  '{"playerId":"nh7bpj2xf1b9qw7x3gx803gr7h7tfqk7"}'

# Audit player balance
npx convex run moderation:auditPlayerBalance \
  '{"playerId":"nh7bpj2xf1b9qw7x3gx803gr7h7tfqk7"}'

# Repair duplicate transactions
npx convex run moderation:repairDuplicateLoanTransactions '{
  "playerId":"nh7bpj2xf1b9qw7x3gx803gr7h7tfqk7",
  "loanAmount":10000000,
  "reason":"Fixed duplicate from race condition"
}'
```

### üìä Automatic Monitoring

```
[NEGATIVE BALANCE ALERT] Found 0 players with negative balances
[FINANCIAL AUDIT] Found 0 players with issues
```

Runs hourly automatically.

## How It Prevents the Issue

### Old Approach ‚ùå
1. Receive loan request
2. 1-second cooldown (too lenient)
3. Create transaction and loan
4. Concurrent requests slip through

### New Approach ‚úÖ
1. Receive loan request (optional idempotency key)
2. **Check 2-second window for identical requests**
3. **If found, return existing loan (idempotent)**
4. Create loan FIRST
5. Re-fetch player latest balance
6. Validate calculation
7. Credit with fresh state
8. Link transaction to loan for audit

---

## Deployment Checklist

```bash
# 1. Deploy code
npx convex deploy

# 2. Generate types
npx convex codegen

# 3. Wait 5 minutes, then verify
npx convex logs --tail | grep "check negative balances"

# 4. Optional: Fix affected player
npx convex run moderation:repairDuplicateLoanTransactions ...
```
