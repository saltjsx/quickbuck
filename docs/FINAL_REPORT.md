## What Was Fixed

### The Problem ❌
- Stock prices updated in database every 5 minutes
- Frontend displayed FAKE/GENERATED data
- `getStockPriceHistory` query existed but never called
- Charts never showed real updates
- All stocks looked identical (generic patterns)

### The Solution ✅
- Created `useStockPriceHistory` hook
- Updated `PriceChart` to use real data
- Updated stock pages to pass `stockId`
- Created admin page for initialization
- All changes verified and documented

### The Result ✅
- Charts display REAL price history
- Updates every 5 minutes automatically
- Real-time via Convex reactivity
- Each stock has unique real pattern
- Admin can initialize on demand
