## Technical Details

### Image Handling
- Images are stored as URLs in the product database
- Images are loaded via standard HTML `<img>` tags
- Fallback icons from lucide-react for missing images
- CSS `object-cover` ensures proper aspect ratio

### Performance
- Images are loaded on-demand (not preloaded)
- Thumbnails are small (fits in ~100KB total per page)
- No additional database queries needed (images already returned)
- Efficient rendering with proper React keys

### Data Flow
```
Backend (convex/products.ts)
  ↓ Returns product with image URL
Frontend Pages
  ↓ Query product data
Components
  ↓ Display image with fallback
User
  ↓ Sees visual product representation
```
