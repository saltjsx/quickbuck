# Quickbuck Game - Development Checklist

## Important Notes
- **Phase 1 Focus**: FUNCTIONALITY ONLY - Use shadcn UI components, don't worry about polish
- **Phase 2 Focus**: UI refinement and polish
- **NO unnecessary README files or documentation** during development
- **All features must have vitest tests** to confirm functionality
- **Type checking and tests must pass** before moving to next section
- **✅ FIXED**: Clerk userId validation - now using findUserByToken to get Convex user ID
