You MUST follow these instructions to ensure this codebase works well.

- ONLY USE SHADCN/UI COMPONENTS FOR NEW UI ELEMENTS.
- No emojis, only icons, if needed
- DO NOT write useless readme files or "documentation" that adds no value.
- Ensure you test code before submitting.
- Never do "npx convex deploy". Only use "npx convex dev", and I will deploy it myself after testing.
- Do NOT do "npm run dev". I already have the server always running.
